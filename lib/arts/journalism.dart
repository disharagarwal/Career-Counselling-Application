              '''Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication is a 3-year undergraduate course divided into six semesters. The course curriculum includes a variety of fields such as Print Journalism, Television and Radio Production, Television Production and Writing, Advertising and Public Relations, Event Management, Social Media, Film Studies, and Media Law and Ethics.
